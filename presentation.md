## Kubernetes everywhere

---

# Why Kubernetes?

--

Discover the benefits of Kubernetes for DevOps teams to orchestrate containers like Docker.

--

Learn to run apps better, heal systems automatically, improve uptime, keep costs down and users happy.

---

# Why Rancher?

--

Rancher is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers.

--

It addresses the operational and security challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure,
while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads.

---

# The basics

Concepts related to Kubernetes that are important for understanding how Rancher works

--

`Kubernetes` is the container cluster management standard.

--

YAML files specify containers and other resources that form an application.

--

Kubernetes performs functions such as scheduling, scaling, service discovery, health check, secret management, and configuration management.

--

A Kubernetes Cluster is a cluster that uses the Kubernetes container-orchestration system to deploy, maintain, and scale Docker containers, allowing your organization to automate application operations.

---

# About Helm

> The package manager for Kubernetes

Helm charts provide templating syntax for Kubernetes YAML manifest documents.

With Helm you can create configurable deployments instead of just using static files

# Roles for Nodes in Kubernetes Clusters

--

Each computing resource in a Kubernetes cluster is called a node.

--

Nodes can be either bare-metal servers or virtual machines.

--

Kubernetes classifies nodes into three types:

- **etcd** nodes
- **control plane** nodes
- **worker** nodes.

--

A Kubernetes cluster consists of at least one etcd, controlplane, and worker node.

---

## etcd nodes

--

The state of a Kubernetes cluster is maintained in etcd. The etcd nodes run the etcd database.

--

The etcd database component is a distributed key-value store used as Kubernetes storage for all cluster data, such as cluster coordination and state management.
It is recommended to run etcd on multiple nodes so that thereâ€™s always a backup available for failover.

--

Although you can run etcd on just one node, etcd requires a majority of nodes, a quorum, to agree on updates to the cluster state.
The cluster should always contain enough healthy etcd nodes to form a quorum.
For a cluster with n members, a quorum is (n/2)+1.

---

## Controlplane Nodes

--

Controlplane nodes run the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, and controller manager.

--

These nodes take care of routine tasks to ensure that your cluster maintains your configuration.

--

You can run control plane on a single node, although two or more nodes are recommended for redundancy.

--

Additionally, a single node can share the control plane and etcd roles.

---

## Worker Nodes

--

Each worker node runs the following:

- **Kubelets**: An agent that monitors the state of the node, ensuring your containers are healthy.
- **Workloads**: The containers and pods that hold your apps, as well as other types of deployments.

--

Worker nodes also run storage and networking drivers, and ingress controllers when required.

You create as many worker nodes as necessary to run your workloads.

# Rancher Architecture

Rancher server, its components, and how Rancher communicates with downstream Kubernetes clusters.

--

## Rancher server

The majority of Rancher 2.x software runs on the Rancher Server.

Rancher Server includes all the software components used to manage the entire Rancher deployment.

The figure illustrates the high-level architecture of Rancher 2.x.

The figure depicts a Rancher Server installation that manages two downstream Kubernetes clusters:

- *Cluster 1*: created by RKE

- *Cluster 3*: created by Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
