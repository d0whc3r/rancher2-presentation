The etcd nodes run the etcd database.\n\n--\n\nThe etcd database component is a distributed key-value store used as Kubernetes storage for all cluster data, such as cluster coordination and state management.\nIt is recommended to run etcd on multiple nodes so that thereâ€™s always a backup available for failover.\n\n--\n\nAlthough you can run etcd on just one node, etcd requires a majority of nodes, a quorum, to agree on updates to the cluster state.\nThe cluster should always contain enough healthy etcd nodes to form a quorum.\nFor a cluster with n members, a quorum is (n/2)+1.\n\n---\n\n## Controlplane Nodes\n\n--\n\nControlplane nodes run the Kubernetes API server, scheduler, and controller manager.\n\n--\n\nThese nodes take care of routine tasks to ensure that your cluster maintains your configuration.\n\n--\n\nYou can run control plane on a single node, although two or more nodes are recommended for redundancy.\n\n--\n\nAdditionally, a single node can share the control plane and etcd roles.\n\n---\n\n## Worker Nodes\n\n--\n\nEach worker node runs the following:\n\n- **Kubelets**: An agent that monitors the state of the node, ensuring your containers are healthy.\n- **Workloads**: The containers and pods that hold your apps, as well as other types of deployments.\n\n--\n\nWorker nodes also run storage and networking drivers, and ingress controllers when required.\n\nYou create as many worker nodes as necessary to run your workloads.\n\n---\n\n# Rancher Architecture\n\nRancher server, its components, and how Rancher communicates with downstream Kubernetes clusters.\n\n--\n\n## Rancher server\n\nThe majority of Rancher 2.x software runs on the Rancher Server.\n\nRancher Server includes all the software components used to manage the entire Rancher deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Rancher server\n\n.col-7[\nThe figure illustrates the high-level architecture of Rancher 2.x.\n\nThe figure depicts a Rancher Server installation that manages two downstream Kubernetes clusters:\n\n- *Cluster 1*: created by RKE\n\n- *Cluster 3*: created by Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).\n]\n.col-5[\n.responsive[![rancher server](./images/rancher-architecture-rancher-api-server.svg)]\n]\n\n---\n\n# Rancher Server Components\n\nThis diagram shows each component that the Rancher server is composed of:\n\n.center[![rancher components](./images/rancher-architecture-rancher-components.svg)]\n\n---\n\n# Rancher/Kubernetes basic concepts\n\n- Namespace\n- Project\n- Services\n- Pods\n- Secrets\n- Storage\n- Permision/roles in rancher\n\n---\n\n# Documentation\n\n[https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/)\n\n[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)\n\n[https://helm.sh/](https://helm.sh/)\n\n[https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/production/](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-provisioning/production/)\n\n## Presentation online in github\n\n[https://d0whc3r.github.io/rancher2-presentation/](https://d0whc3r.github.io/rancher2-presentation/)\n\n[https://rancher2-presentation.netlify.app](https://rancher2-presentation.netlify.app)\n\n---\n\n.center.huge.primary[**DEMO TIME**]\n\n- Deploy cluster in google cloud/aws/hetzner\n- Deploy sample project using gitlab CI/CD\n- Configure prometheus + grafana for entire cluster\n- Configure alerts in email/slack\n- Auto scaling\n- Cluster backup (velero) in s3 (minio)\n",
